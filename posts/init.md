So it seems it's the year of the blogs again. I figured it would be a good
exercise to get back into it and share some of the things I experiment with,
especially related to programming and surrounding topics.

A few words about me first for those who don't know who I am. I am a mid-century
software engineer, in that soft spot between "experienced" and soon to be
considered a fossil I suppose. I currently work for Exoscale, a European Cloud
platform. Even though what I mention on this blog might occasionally refer to
what I do at work indirectly, these are my words only.

One subject that has been occupying my mind quite a bit lately is complexity in
software design in orgs with multiple dev teams. Don't leave just yet! So expect
to see a bit of writing about this topic in the future.

I swear I won't bore about mono/mini/macro/ repos & the like.

I have a few other things in my bag such as various clojure related topics and
subjects related to what I work on day to day, various types of orchestrators
that power a cloud platform such as exoscale.  I might also drop the occasional
emacs discovery.

But for now I am just getting this bloging engine setup, courtesy of
[https://blog.michielborkent.nl/](Michiel Borkent), and will iterate from there.

See you on the next one!
